# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

### Challenge

Outcomes Based on Goal:
Lines in successful and failed kickstarters are moving in the oposit directions. 
There are three points where the lines intersect, which means that at these levels of goals 50% of kickstarters succeed and 50% fail. 
Highest numbers of successfull campaigns are with low goals below 1000 and another peak is $35,000-40,000.
Data with the highest goals have to be taken with a grain of salt, because there are only a few kickstarters.

Outcomes Based on Launch Date:
The most successfull months to launch a campaign is May and June. We can see a rise in successfull kickstarters starting in April with a peak in May and then decline till October. In Octobere there is another peek of successfull kickstarters.
We see similar trend in failed kickstarters, most fails in May and October.
Looking at the available data, rate of canceled kickstarters is very similar during the year, except on the month of October when we dont have any available data.
